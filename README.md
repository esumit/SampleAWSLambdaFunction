# SampleAWSLambdaFunction
A Sample AWS Lambda Function to test the logging functioning, and steps to  test the functioning of AWS Lambda within AWS Console.

About AWS Lambda Functions
-----------------------------
lets you run code without thinking about servers.
You pay only for the compute time you consume â€” there is no charge when your code is not running. With Lambda, you can run code for virtually any type of application or backend service, all with zero administration.

Step-1 Build AWS Lambda Function 
-----------------------------

Step-6 Go To Monitoring and Click everywhere to see the AWS monitoring offernings

If you have done all steps as above then congratulations you know AWS Lambda :-)

So what next ? - Its just running a function and that's it ? - What is the use of it ?

Hmmm

There are many, One of the example one : Connect this with Another feature of AWS name API Gateway , It provides functions to quickly create REST APIs and binds Lambda Function as Backend, and sure Lambda Function can connect to DB as well
